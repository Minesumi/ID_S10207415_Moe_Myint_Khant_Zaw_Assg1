      <h2>History Of MrBeast</h2>
      <p>Since 2012, a 13 years old boy named Jimmy Donaldson uploaded his videos of gaming on the YouTube channel named "MrBeast6000". Some of his videos were clickbaits at that time. He did not get much views until 2017, when he uploaded a video of counting to 100,000 in one sitting which took him about 40 hours. Then, after he became a little famous, he made videos about experiments that are not done by others, which made his channel even more popular. And then, he made videos about how he gives away the money he makes from YouTube and from his sponsors.
